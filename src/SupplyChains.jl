"""
Logistics in a system are the mechanisms for satisfying demands, such are raw
materials or time, under certain restrictions, usually a budget, while
optimizing a cost.

In an industrial environment, the losgistics are the supply chain. It usually
has two stages: a production chain and a distribution chain.

In this toy example, the production chain has some fixed raw materials suppliers
and some assembly plants. The distribution chain has some distribution center
(supplied by the assembly plants) and selling points.

Each installation has a fixed operation cost, and transportation between
installations has a cost per unit. Suppliers, assembly plants and distribution
centers have a maximum capacity, and selling points have a demand.
